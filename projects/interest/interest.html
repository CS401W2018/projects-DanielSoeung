        <h2 class="emp">Volleyball</h2>
        <p> Volleyball is sport inspired by many others before its existence. Some of these sports include, tennis, basketball and handball. I grew to love the sport in my 2 years playing as a Libero for my Highschool team. My job was to prevent the ball from touch the floor on our side of court. I had to read hitters and give signals to others the next play or how the block is angled for a spike. 
            I loved my role because it required fast-pace and dynamic movements to fulfill the goal of a Libero. You have to hustle, chase and often times dive for game saving plays. My journey in the sport has brought to love watching the sport on an international level like the FIVB or the Olympics. Its exciting and electrifying nature is what is so fun.</p>
