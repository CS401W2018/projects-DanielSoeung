    <h2> Interests: </h2>
    <p> Aloha my name is Daniel Soeung &amp; from Cambodia, although many call me <mark>Daniel Son like Karate Kid</mark>. Growing up soccer was everything in my life. My favorite soccer had always been Ronaldo so everytime I play the sport I always try to play like him. Soccer in Cambodia was different though, instead of lush green grass or turf fields, we played on uneven concrete grounds with a small bamboo woven soccer ball. Moreover would play on barefoot and use our slippers as goals. </p>
    <p> Besides soccer, volleyball became a sport I loved dearly. <strong> I played the sport competitively in high school for two years in Utah</strong>. During my time I played as a Libero and helped my team to win the state championship title. I loved the dynamic aspect of being a Libero. Your job to defend, quickly adjust to attackers and make game changing saves is what makes me so excited about the position and the sport.</p>
