        <p>What you learned about Flex and CSS.</p>
        <p> Through the games we did in class I was able to gain a better understanding of how flex works in CSS. I also enjoyed reading about the different properties that you can apply to both the parent and the children inside of flex.</p>
        <p>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</p>
        <p> An accessible website should be a website that everyone can access. That means that the website is access by multiple devices, and those who may have disabilities.</p>
