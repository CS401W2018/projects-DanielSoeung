        <h3>What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</h3>
        <p> It is a good thing to do because you don't have to pay for the hosting. However, it can be difficult because you could be viewing ads as well as the option for the publisher to embed to the video for external use.</p>
        <h3>What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</h3>
        <p> You can rotate and scale your content.</p>
        <h3>How do you stay safe online?</h3>
        <p> Be careful of what you put online. Make sure you put things that you are ok with other people seeing on the web. Make sure the things you posted will not give hackers any hints or clue to all your other personal information.</p>
        <h3>What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</h3>
