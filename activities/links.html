        <h2> Questions </h2>
        <p>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links? </p>
        <p> An absolute link is a link that contains all the information required to access the webpage. Relative links are links within your own domain. Which means that the link has to have the same domain as the page you are linking it from. Instead of usisng everything needed as in absolute you can just use the file name.</p>
        <p>List the 3 rules with relative links</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li> Use the file name </li>
            <li> To up to a directory use ../file name</li>
            <li> Start at the root "/"</li>

        </ol>
        <p> Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag? </p>
        <p> No links do not always have to be inside the NAV tag. They can be outside the nav as well.</p>
