    <header><h1> Final Proposal</h1></header>
    <h3>Title and topic of site</h3>
    <p> The title will be "Formula 1" the topic I will specifically focus on the racing sport and the different drivers in the sport. Almost like a stats page.</p>
    <h3> Why you choose this topic?</h3>
    <p> I've always been interested in F1. I want to show the cars and the drivers. Moreover, I've never really looked into the stats of the different drivers and see how well they do in the races.</p>
    <h3> Pages </h3>
    <p> 1- Home page</p>
    <p> 2- This page will be explaining the goal and rules of sport as an introduction for those who are unfamiliar to the sport.</p>
    <p> 3- A page showing all the cars of each team in cards.</p>
    <p> 4- A page showing all the drivers in the sport in cards.</p>
    <p> 5- The table will include the wins of each team in the constructor championship and also the driver championship.</p>
    <h3>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h3>
    <p> For the fields I will collect:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Name </li>
        <li> Age</li>
        <li> Gender</li>
        <li> Favorite team</li>
        <li> I agree the terms field </li>
    </ol>
    <p> For my table I want to include the individual stats or each team in the sport. This could be wins or most points earned in the season. Moreover, I also want to include a table showcasing all the races taking place and what team won in each track.</p>
    <h3>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h3>
    <h4> Image Sources/Reference</h4>
    <p> For my images and content I will be using google and I will try to find ones with a creative common license.</p>
