        <h3> Why Soccer?</h3>
        <p> Soccer to many is just a sport but to some like me soccer was our childhood. In Cambodia one of the most common ways to play soccer was barefooted. We would play on the rough and rigid gravel like surface and grab anything that would be visible to put as our goals. The games were fast paced and most of the time the balls were made out of bamboo. Playing soccer was special to me it taught me to persevere playing barefooted but also to have confidence in taking defenders in a face paced environment. However one lesson that stuck with me was the importance of passing the ball. It was true that most of the games I play where just skills shows but when it came to scoring you couldn't rely entirely on yourself you needed your team to start or make a play. Without teammates you would have a hard time progressing towards the goal. In my life I have come to recognize the importance of getting help from others and helping others. We think that we can do everything ourselves but that is not always the case. There are people that care and want to help you.</p>
